RELATIONAL DATABASE
Represents a collection of related 2D tables.
* Similar to an Excel spreadsheet.
* Each table has columns with all of the data being rows.
    - So, when we create a table in SQL, we are essentially making the header for the table.

DMV, for instance would have tables that contain rows for all of their drivers.
* Then, there would be columns like ID, make/model, wheel #, doors #, and type
